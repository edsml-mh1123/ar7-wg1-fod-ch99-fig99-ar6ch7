## Description

Write a clear, concise, and self-contained description of the figure:

- What does the figure show?

- What datasets/models are used?

- What time period does it cover?

- Any important features or highlights?


## Installation

example:

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/YOUR_REPO.git
cd YOUR_REPO
```

2. Create the environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This will create a new conda environment with the name defined in the environment.yml file (e.g., ipcc-fig-env).

3. Activate the environment

```bash
conda activate ipcc-fig-env
```

4. Run the figure generation pipeline
